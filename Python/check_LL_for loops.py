From Kapil Sharma's lecture 08-20-2020
'Given a linked list, found out if it has any loops.'
His question: Why would it be helpful to know whether a linked list is cyclic?
    Some reasons include:
    1. You might get stuck in an infinite loop trying to traverse it.
    2. You might not be able to add to it.
Example of acyclic linked list: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8

First step: create a Node class. Then make sure with the interviewer that your implementation aligns with what they wanted it to look like.
Second: create two pointers, a fast one that skips ahead 2 nodes at a time, and a slow one that visits each node, advancing one at a time.
    If the pointers ever point to the same node, we will know that the linked list is cyclic.
    If the pointers ever point to None, we will know that the linked list is acyclic.
