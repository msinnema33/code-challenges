# Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, 
# each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, 
# he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than 
# the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. 
# Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.

# Example

# For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
# makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.

# Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.

# Input/Output

# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] array.integer statues

# An array of distinct non-negative integers.

# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 ≤ statues.length ≤ 10,
# 0 ≤ statues[i] ≤ 20.

# [output] integer

# The minimal number of statues that need to be added to existing statues such that
#  it contains every integer size from an interval [L, R] (for some L, R) and no other sizes.


def makeArrayConsecutive2(statues):
    # a
    statues.sort()
    # b
    fL = 0
    # c
    sL = 1
    lastItem = len(statues)-1
    # d
    differences = 0
    # e
    while (fL <= lastItem - 1) and (sL <= lastItem):
      # f
      if statues[sL] - statues[fL] > 1:
          differences += (statues[sL] - statues[fL] - 1)
      # g
      fL += 1
      sL += 1

    return differences

# a) First, sorting the array from least to greatest would make this process simpler, thankfully there's a built in method for that ( called .sort())

# b) fL loops from 0 to the second last element in the array (also look at the while statement)

# c) sL loops from 1 to the last element in the array (also look at the while statement)

# d) the differences variable keeps track of the number of statues needed to fill in between two consecutive numbers so say the numbers were 5 and 9, differences would hold 3 because you need three statues (6,7,8) to go in-between those two numbers.

# e) Inside the while loop, it records the number of statues that can go in-between every adjacent pairs.

# f) Inside the if statement, if difference between two consecutive number is more than one (ie. The difference between 6 and 7 is 1, but you cant put a statue in-between, so we look for a difference of higher than 1 for each consecutive pairs).

# g) fL and sL are incremented by 1 as they continue the loop.
